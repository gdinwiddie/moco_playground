# Moco Playground

I found a nifty little tool, **Moco** (https://github.com/dreamhead/moco) for creating stub web services. Unfortunately, the documentation for Moco is a bit thin and, to me, sometimes confusing. I set up this project to play with it a bit. Perhaps it will help you get started more quickly.
